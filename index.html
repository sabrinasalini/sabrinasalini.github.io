<h2 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h2>
<p>
 I was born in Kirkland, Washington but moved around the United States for a while until I got into
 high school and then was settled back down in Kirkland, Washington.

  <h4>accessible: I'm trying to make everything clear and easy as possible to use for everyone
  by making it simple and straightforward</h4>
  <h4>I thought it was pretty cool that people were changing the background color and you do that
    by coding body style= and by typing in the color of the background. </h4>
  <h4>I'm most proud of coding every single thing that was on my website to my liking.</h4>
