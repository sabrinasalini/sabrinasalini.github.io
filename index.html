 to high school and then was settled down back in Kirkland. When I was younger I've always wanted to be a nurse but then in Junior high
 I was indroduced to the tech field through a summer camp for stem.

  <h4>I thought it was pretty cool that people were changing the background color and you do that
  by coding <body style="background-color:the actual color;">.</h4>
  <h4>I'm most proud of coding every single thing that was on my website to my liking.</h4>
