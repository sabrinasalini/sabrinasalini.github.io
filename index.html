<p>
 I was born in Kirkland, Washington but was moved around the United States for a while Until I got 
 to high school and then was settled down back in Kirkland. When I was younger I've always wanted to be a nurse but then in Junior high
 I was indroduced to the tech field through a summer camp for stem.
